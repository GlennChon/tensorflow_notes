    "### Converting text into numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization vs Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, there are two main concepts for turning text into numbers:\n",
    "* **Tokenization** - A straight mapping from word or character or sub-word to a numerical value. There are three main levels of tokenization:\n",
    "  1. Using **word-level tokenization** with the sentence \"I love TensorFlow\" might result in \"I\" being `0`, \"love\" being `1` and \"TensorFlow\" being `2`. In this case, every word in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n",
    "  2. **Character-level tokenization**, such as converting the letters A-Z to values `1-26`. In this case, every character in a sequence considered a single **token**.\n",
    "  3. **Sub-word tokenization** is in between word-level and character-level tokenization. It involves breaking invidual words into smaller parts and then converting those smaller parts into numbers. For example, \"my favourite food is pineapple pizza\" might become \"my, fav, avour, rite, fo, oo, od, is, pin, ine, app, le, piz, za\". After doing this, these sub-words would then be mapped to a numerical value. In this case, every word could be considered multiple **tokens**.\n",
    "* **Embeddings** - An embedding is a representation of natural language which can be learned. Representation comes in the form of a **feature vector**. For example, the word \"dance\" could be represented by the 5-dimensional vector `[-0.8547, 0.4559, -0.3332, 0.9877, 0.1112]`. It's important to note here, the size of the feature vector is tuneable. There are two ways to use embeddings: \n",
    "  1. **Create your own embedding** - Once your text has been turned into numbers (required for an embedding), you can put them through an embedding layer (such as [`tf.keras.layers.Embedding`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding)) and an embedding representation will be learned during model training.\n",
    "  2. **Reuse a pre-learned embedding** - Many pre-trained embeddings exist online. These pre-trained embeddings have often been learned on large corpuses of text (such as all of Wikipedia) and thus have a good underlying representation of natural language. You can use a pre-trained embedding to initialize your model and fine-tune it to your own specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/main/images/08-tokenization-vs-embedding.png)\n",
    "*Example of **tokenization** (straight mapping from word to number) and **embedding** (richer representation of relationships between tokens).*\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on your problem. You could try character-level tokenization/embeddings and word-level tokenization/embeddings and see which perform best. You might even want to try stacking them (e.g. combining the outputs of your embedding layers using [`tf.keras.layers.concatenate`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/concatenate)). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're looking for pre-trained word embeddings, [Word2vec embeddings](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/), [GloVe embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and many of the options available on [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=text-embedding) are great places to start."
